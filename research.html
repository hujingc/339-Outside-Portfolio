            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I like to use a combination of physical experiments and computer simulation to solve engineering
                problems. Physical experiments can more closely represent what is happening in a system, but simulation
                will let you see inside that system and visualize specific relationships or data that you would not be
                able to get otherwise. It's a win-win! And by "physical experiments" I don't just mean making waves in
                the towing tank. If you're in my class, you're probably helping me run an experiment, too!

                I am also a big proponent of open source software. If you don't already know LaTeX, stop reading this
                and go learn it right now. </p>

<section id='areas'><h2>Active Areas of Research</h2><p>I am not very good at settling down to one topic of research.  There are just too many interesting problems to solve!  This is what I'm currently working on, though.

    effects of project-based learning and teams on first-year undergraduate engineering students 
    
    I have taught a first-year intro to engineering course for many years, and we are always fiddling with it and trying to make it a better course.  Recently, my co-instructors and I decided to begin assessing whether our chosen approaches are working or not.  We frequently present at the ASEE annual conference.  
    
    I am a faculty collaborator on Tandem, a team support tool being developed by U-M's Center for Academic Innovation.
    
    effects of implicit bias on obstacles to student learning (or, as I like to call it, "How Not to Be a Primitive Asshole")
    
    Implicit biases are biases we have for or against people and things... but we don't know we have these biases.  We absorb them through the societies that we move through.  An unknown bias can put you in uncomfortable situations by, essentially, making you act like an ignorant idiot when consciously you definitely know better.  By recognizing potential implicit biases, we can bring our brains into the 21st century and make working with each other way more easier and a lot more fun.</p></section>
