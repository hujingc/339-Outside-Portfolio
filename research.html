        <section id='notice'>
            <h4><strong>I do not have research openings at this time.</strong></h4>
            <p>Thank you to those of you who have emailed me asking about research opportunities or to join my lab. I
                teach
                full-time, and so I do not conduct regular research. I do not have a research lab, nor do I have any
                research openings at this time.

        <section id='philosophy'>
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I like to use a combination of physical experiments and computer simulation to solve engineering
                problems. Physical experiments can more closely represent what is happening in a system, but simulation
                will let you see inside that system and visualize specific relationships or data that you would not be
                able to get otherwise. It's a win-win! And by "physical experiments" I don't just mean making waves in
                the towing tank. If you're in my class, you're probably helping me run an experiment, too!

                I am also a big proponent of open source software. If you don't already know <a
                    href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX'>
                    LaTeX</a>, stop reading this
                and go learn it right now. </p>

            <h2>Active Areas of Research</h2>
            <p>I am not very good at settling down to one topic of research. There are just too many interesting
                problems to solve! This is what I'm currently working on, though.
            </p>
            <h3>Effects of Project-based Learning and Teams on First-year Undergraduate Engineering Students</h3>

            <p>I have taught a first-year intro to engineering course for many years, and we are always fiddling with
                it and trying to make it a better course. Recently, my co-instructors and I decided to begin assessing
                whether our chosen approaches are working or not. We frequently present at the <a
                    href='http://asee.org/'>ASEE</a> annual conference.

                I am a faculty collaborator on Tandem, a team support tool being developed by U-M's Center for Academic
                Innovation.</p>

            <h3>Effects of Implicit Bias on Obstacles to Student Learning(or, as I like to call it, "How Not to Be a
                Primitive Asshole")</h3>
            <p>
                Implicit biases are biases we have for or against people and things... but we don't know we have these
                biases. We absorb them through the societies that we move through. An unknown bias can put you in
                uncomfortable situations by, essentially, making you act like an ignorant idiot when consciously you
                definitely know better. By recognizing potential implicit biases, we can bring our brains into the 21st
                century and make working with each other way more easier and a lot more fun.</p>

            <h2>Past Areas of Research</h2>
            <p>These are some things I've worked on in the past. They'll probably resurface in the future, too. Circle
                of life and all that.
            </p>
            <h3>Hydrodynamics of Marine Structures</h3>

            <p>I conducted research on the hydrodynamics of a variety of marine structures. Everything from Navy ships
                to fish spawning reefs. I primarily used <a href='http://www.openfoam.com/'>OpenFOAM</a> to simulate the
                fluid flow and around structures. The
                simulations were validated against real world data such as model tests, ship sea trials, or river flow
                data.
            </p>
            <h3>Design Loads for Ships and Marine Structures Using Probabilistic Methods</h3>
            <p>
                My dissertation work centered on using extreme value theory to generate extreme ship responses in a
                rational way. The details are <a href='http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/58469'>here</a>. In short, waves
                that might be dangerous for one ship might NOT be
                dangerous for a different type of ship. This approach uses what we know about a given ship's movement in
                waves to find the waves that will cause big motions of the ship so that you only have to simulate a few
                cases to produce the extreme stresses the ship or structure will see. This information can then be
                handed off to the structural engineers so the ship structure can be designed to withstand these design
                loads.

                My original method was improved by the student following me, Dae-Hyun Kim, and the details of his work
                are here. The result is what we call the Design Loads Generator (DLG), and it runs very quickly because
                it is based on linear theory. The output of the DLG are sets of wave conditions that will lead to
                linear-based extreme responses. Unfortunately, the entire world is nonlinear. So, we take the DLG wave
                conditions and run them through high fidelity nonlinear codes, such as OpenFOAM, to generate more
                accurate maps of pressure and stress on the marine structure.</p>

            <h3>Microplastic Pollution in the Great Lakes</h3>
            <p>
                I grew up in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, MI, and the Great Lakes have always been near and dear to my
                heart. When I stumbled on the issue of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics'>microplastic
                    pollution</a>, I decided I needed to act. After all,
                engineering is causing this problem, so engineering ought to help solve it! At <a
                    href='http://iaglr.org/'>IAGLR 2014</a>, I chaired a
                session on microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes, and we brought together many of the active
                researchers in this area. This session also supported NOAA's <a
                    href='http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/regional-coordination/great-lakes-action-plan'>Great Lakes
                    Land-based Marine Debris Action
                    Plan</a>. In 2016, I was part of <a href='http://exxpedition.com/greatlakes2016/'>eXXpedition Great
                    Lakes 2016</a>, in which researchers all around the Great
                Lakes sampled for microplastics. </p>
