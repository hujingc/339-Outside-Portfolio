                    teach

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I like to use a combination of physical experiments and computer simulation to solve engineering
                    problems. Physical experiments can more closely represent what is happening in a system, but
                    simulation
                    will let you see inside that system and visualize specific relationships or data that you would not
                    be
                    able to get otherwise. It's a win-win! And by "physical experiments" I don't just mean making waves
                    in
                    the towing tank. If you're in my class, you're probably helping me run an experiment, too!

                    I am also a big proponent of open source software. If you don't already know <a

                <h2>Active Areas of Research</h2>
                <p>I am not very good at settling down to one topic of research. There are just too many interesting
                    problems to solve! This is what I'm currently working on, though.

                <h3>Effects of Project-based Learning and Teams on First-year Undergraduate Engineering Students</h3>

                <p>I have taught a first-year intro to engineering course for many years, and we are always fiddling
                    with
                    it and trying to make it a better course. Recently, my co-instructors and I decided to begin
                    assessing
                    whether our chosen approaches are working or not. We frequently present at the <a
                        href='http://asee.org/'>ASEE</a> annual conference.

                    I am a faculty collaborator on Tandem, a team support tool being developed by U-M's Center for

                                    Tandem is an online tool designed to help people function better on teams and to
                                    help
                                    instructors/managers better support those teams. Currently, Tandem is being used by
                                    student teams in a higher education setting. In the future, we hope to expand to
                                    teams
                                    in other settings, such as secondary education and industry. Tandem is being
                                    developed
                                    by the University of Michigan's Center for Academic Innovation.

                                    transparency on teams and provide timely support and instruction based on each

                <p>
                    Implicit biases are biases we have for or against people and things... but we don't know we have
                    these
                    biases. We absorb them through the societies that we move through. An unknown bias can put you in
                    uncomfortable situations by, essentially, making you act like an ignorant idiot when consciously you
                    definitely know better. By recognizing potential implicit biases, we can bring our brains into the
                    21st
                    century and make working with each other way more easier and a lot more fun.</p>

                <h2>Past Areas of Research</h2>
                <p>These are some things I've worked on in the past. They'll probably resurface in the future, too.
                    Circle

                <h3>Hydrodynamics of Marine Structures</h3>

                <p>I conducted research on the hydrodynamics of a variety of marine structures. Everything from Navy
                    ships
                    to fish spawning reefs. I primarily used <a href='http://www.openfoam.com/'>OpenFOAM</a> to simulate
                    the
                    fluid flow and around structures. The
                    simulations were validated against real world data such as model tests, ship sea trials, or river
                    flow
                    data.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Loads for Ships and Marine Structures Using Probabilistic Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    My dissertation work centered on using extreme value theory to generate extreme ship responses in a
                    rational way. The details are <a href='http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/58469'>here</a>. In short,
                    waves
                    that might be dangerous for one ship might NOT be
                    dangerous for a different type of ship. This approach uses what we know about a given ship's
                    movement in
                    waves to find the waves that will cause big motions of the ship so that you only have to simulate a
                    few
                    cases to produce the extreme stresses the ship or structure will see. This information can then be
                    handed off to the structural engineers so the ship structure can be designed to withstand these
                    design
                    loads.

                    My original method was improved by the student following me, Dae-Hyun Kim, and the details of his
                    work
                    are here. The result is what we call the Design Loads Generator (DLG), and it runs very quickly
                    because
                    it is based on linear theory. The output of the DLG are sets of wave conditions that will lead to
                    linear-based extreme responses. Unfortunately, the entire world is nonlinear. So, we take the DLG
                    wave
                    conditions and run them through high fidelity nonlinear codes, such as OpenFOAM, to generate more
                    accurate maps of pressure and stress on the marine structure.</p>

                        pollution</a>, I decided I needed to act. After all,
                    engineering is causing this problem, so engineering ought to help solve it! At <a
                        href='http://iaglr.org/'>IAGLR 2014</a>, I chaired a
                    session on microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes, and we brought together many of the active
                    researchers in this area. This session also supported NOAA's <a
                        href='http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/regional-coordination/great-lakes-action-plan'>Great Lakes
                        Land-based Marine Debris Action
                        Plan</a>. In 2016, I was part of <a href='http://exxpedition.com/greatlakes2016/'>eXXpedition
                        Great
                        Lakes 2016</a>, in which researchers all around the Great
                    Lakes sampled for microplastics. </p>
