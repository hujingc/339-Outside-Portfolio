        <p>
            I try to emulate all the best teachers I've ever had, and I try to do the opposite of all the bad teachers
            I've ever had! Mostly, though, I try to remember that my students are people, too, and we all have lives
            outside of class. I try not to overload them with work just for my class, and I hope that they remember that
            I'm not continually hanging out online waiting to immediately respond to a question they post. I encourage
            empathy in my students and myself and consider humor a valuable teaching tool.

        <h3>Current Courses</h3>

        <h4>Engr 100: Intro to Engineering, Underwater Vehicle Design</h4>
        <p>
            This is an intensive first-year course for engineering students that covers engineering design and
            technical communication. All first-year engineering students are required to take this class. There are many
            sections to choose from, each with its own flavor. Mine, as you might image, has a naval architecture and
            marine engineering flavor. I am the technical instructor for
            Section 600, in which students work in teams of five to build <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow">Remotely Operated Vehicles</a> over the course
            of the semester as part of a design-build-test-communicate cycle. You will <i>not</i> become an expert
            hydrodynamicist in Engr 100-600. However, you
            <i>will</i> get exposure to the following engineering
            topics within the context of the ROV project: team communication and collaboration, 3D modeling and
            printing, pressure, buoyancy, stability, technical documentation (presentations and reports), basic
            electric circuits, systems design, probability, statistics, risk, and ethics. Whew! Thank goodness I have
            excellent co-instructors and teaching
            assistants!

        <aside>If you are a current U-M student who is trying to figure out what section of Engr
            100 to take, here is a more
            detailed course description for Section 600 that might help you in your
            decision-making.</aside>

                        This is a design-build-test-communicate course with a heavy emphasis on team-based,
                        project-based, collaborative learning. That mouthful is a fancy way of saying: you will gain a
                        lot of introductory-level engineering experience by building something interesting with a group
                        of people!

                        <h4>Project</h4>
                        <p>
                            In our section, you will work in a team of five to design, build, test, and communicate
                            about a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), sometimes called a submersible, for underwater
                            exploration. The ROV has a set of tasks that it will need to do, but otherwise this is a
                            “free design” project with minimal constraints on size, shape, and function. Your team will
                            be provided with raw building materials, four thrusters, a blank control box, toggle
                            switches and buttons, and a payload consisting of a battery, a video camera (to “see what
                            the ROV sees” and help complete the set of tasks), and a tether to a float. The float
                            connects wirelessly to a control box that you will design and build. You will have an
                            opportunity to test your ROV in the towing tank at the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory (MHL)
                            in West Hall. An ROV competition is held on a weekend near the end of the semester at the
                            MHL. At the competition, your team will present its ROV design to our industry sponsor and
                            then conduct final ROV testing in the MHL’s towing tank. A written progress report and a
                            final report are also deliverables for this project.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Lecture, Discussion, and Lab</h4>

                        <p>This section has a lecture component, a discussion component, and a lab component. The
                            lectures are a time when content is provided and/or practiced; they are highly
                            group/team-oriented and taught in a “studio” style where you sit with your team or other
                            small group. Discussions are a time when we provide and practice content that is more
                            suitable to a smaller class size. Labs are when you will gain the hands-on build and test
                            experience with your team. Throughout the course, collaboration is highly encouraged and
                            required. To emphasize the importance of collaboration in Engr 100-600, course engagement
                            points are assigned to many activities in lecture, discussion, and lab. If you miss a lot of
                            class, you will not earn these points, and it will be difficult to do well in the course.
                        </p>

                        <p>Your team will use a dedicated lab to construct and test your ROV during regular lab times
                            and open lab times provided by the Instructional Assistants (IAs) for the class. Peer
                            mentors -- students who have previously taken this course -- are assigned to each team to
                            provide design guidance and offer support.</p>

                        <h4>Course Content and Workload</h4>

                        <p>The goal of Engr 100-600 is to provide an opportunity for you to gain experience in a wide
                            range of engineering skills. Before you get super excited that you are going to become an
                            expert hydrodynamicist after a single introductory engineering course, we want to remind you
                            that this is an intro course. And it’s an intro course that is focused on communication and
                            hands-on learning in a general engineering sense. We don’t have the time to go deep into any
                            technical content. However, we will touch on the following engineering topics within the
                            context of the ROV project: team communication and collaboration, 3D modeling and printing,
                            pressure, buoyancy, stability, technical documentation (presentations and reports), basic
                            electric circuits, systems design, probability, statistics, risk, and ethics.</p>

                        <p>Fair warning: Past students generally report that the workload for Engr 100-600 is higher
                            than other sections of Engr 100 but that the extra work is worth it. More than one of our
                            past students has said that they owe a summer internship after their first year in college
                            to the experience they could list after taking Engr 100-600.</p>

                        <h4>Should you take this course?</h4>

                        <p>This course will likely be of greatest interest to those students looking to major in naval
                            architecture & marine engineering, but any student who is interested in a rewarding,
                            hands-on introduction to engineering at U-M is very welcome. We’ve worked hard to create a
                            multi-disciplinary project that will appeal to a wide range of students, so hopefully
                            everyone will find something interesting to do!</p>

                        <p>If you are hoping to register for this section in the fall term but find that it is already
                            full, please email the First-Year Programs Coordinator, Krista Quinn, at
                            engin-fyp-at-umich.edu to request your name be added to a list for winter term.

        <h4>Engr 101: Intro to Computer Programming</h4>
        <p>
            Okay, so this is another course that first-year engineering students are required to take. But this one
            is run a little differently than Engr 100. Engr 101 is run as one giant course, with about 700 students a
            semester, broken into 3 lectures, one of
            which I teach. But don't worry! We have a huge team of fantastic graduate and undergraduate
            instructors to help us; they are from all the different engineering departments and they are eager
            to help you learn to harness your most powerful engineering tool: your computer. We focus on solving
            real-world engineering problems using computer programming to automate our calculations and
            display our data so we can make informed decisions. There are 6 projects that will guide you through
            solving engineering problems using computer programming such as error analysis, system coefficient
            selection, health monitoring, and delivery logistics. If you
            have experience with programming already, each project has a number of "reach goals" to keep you
            honing those programming skills. No matter what your skill level is, come hang out with us during
            office hours and see how truly powerful your computer can be with you at the helm (yeah, had to work
            in a naval arch reference there). I promise, I'll bring fruit snacks for when we're ready to pull
            out our hair because we can't find that one bug.

        <h4>
            Hydrostatics Short Course, Naval Engineering Education Center (NEEC)
        </h4>
        <p>
            I created a series of short video lectures on basic hydrostatics concepts for the Naval Engineering
            Education
            Center (NEEC). These videos are aimed at
            familiarizing new Navy hires whom do not have prior ship experience with some basic ship terminology
            and concepts in how to keep your ship from sinking. Watch the
            videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iml-lynj3bM&amp;list=PLxHEvq_hK_PzM0HSlNIvSFrmiSgDC2sC1"

            official capacity, at least. It's not like the bar is very high for entry to YouTube.)
