        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>I try to emulate all the best teachers I've ever had, and I try to do the opposite of all the bad teachers
            I've ever had! Mostly, though, I try to remember that my students are people, too, and we all have lives
            outside of class. I try not to overload them with work just for my class, and I hope that they remember that
            I'm not continually hanging out online waiting to immediately respond to a question they post. I encourage
            empathy in my students and myself and consider humor a valuable teaching tool.</p>

        <h3>Current Courses</h3>

        <h4>Engr 100: Intro to Engineering, Underwater Vehicle Design</h4>
        <p>This is an intensive first-year course for engineering students that covers engineering design and
            technical communication. All first-year engineering students are required to take this class. There are many
            sections to choose from, each with its own flavor. Mine, as you might image, has a naval architecture and
            marine engineering flavor. I am the technical instructor for
            Section 600, in which students work in teams of five to build <a

                rel="nofollow">Remotely Operated Vehicles</a> over the course
            of the semester as part of a design-build-test-communicate cycle. You will <i>not</i> become an expert
            hydrodynamicist in Engr 100-600. However, you
            <i>will</i> get exposure to the following engineering
            topics within the context of the ROV project: team communication and collaboration, 3D modeling and
            printing, pressure, buoyancy, stability, technical documentation (presentations and reports), basic
            electric circuits, systems design, probability, statistics, risk, and ethics. Whew! Thank goodness I have
            excellent co-instructors and teaching
            assistants!</p>

            100 to take, here is a (fix link)<a

                detailed course description for Section 600</a> that might help you in your
            decision-making.</p>
        <h4>Engr 101: Intro to Computer Programming</h4>
        <p>Okay, so this is another course that first-year engineering students are required to take. But this one
            is run a little differently than Engr 100. Engr 101 is run as one giant course, with about 700 students a
            semester, broken into 3 lectures, one of
            which I teach. But don't worry! We have a huge team of fantastic graduate and undergraduate
            instructors to help us; they are from all the different engineering departments and they are eager
            to help you learn to harness your most powerful engineering tool: your computer. We focus on solving
            real-world engineering problems using computer programming to automate our calculations and
            display our data so we can make informed decisions. There are 6 projects that will guide you through
            solving engineering problems using computer programming such as error analysis, system coefficient
            selection, health monitoring, and delivery logistics. If you
            have experience with programming already, each project has a number of "reach goals" to keep you
            honing those programming skills. No matter what your skill level is, come hang out with us during
            office hours and see how truly powerful your computer can be with you at the helm (yeah, had to work
            in a naval arch reference there). I promise, I'll bring fruit snacks for when we're ready to pull
            out our hair because we can't find that one bug.

        <h4>
            Hydrostatics Short Course, Naval Engineering Education Center (NEEC)</h4>
        <p>I created a series of short video lectures on basic hydrostatics concepts for the Naval Engineering Education
            Center (NEEC). These videos are aimed at
            familiarizing new Navy hires whom do not have prior ship experience with some basic ship terminology
            and concepts in how to keep your ship from sinking. Watch the
            videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iml-lynj3bM&amp;list=PLxHEvq_hK_PzM0HSlNIvSFrmiSgDC2sC1"
                style="line-height:1.5" target="_blank">here</a>. I can't believe I'm on YouTube. (Well, in an
            official capacity, at least. It's not like the bar is very high for entry to YouTube.)</p>
